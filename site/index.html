                <p>A nice start to the 'Real Beginners' classes!  I've reviewed and posted the Takaya-Alan game.  
                Also, the problems I gave out are up, too.  If you're having trouble with them, we will go over
                it next Thursday.</p>
                <p>I think I gave out problems which were a bit too hard for the first day!  Sorry!</p>
