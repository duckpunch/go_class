C[Go is usually split up into 3 phases.  Fuseki, chuuban, and yose.  They mean "the opening", "the middlegame", and "the endgame", respectively.

This lesson is about the end game.]
;AW[eb][ec][dd][ed][de][df][dg][dh][di][fi][gi][hi]AB[fb][fc][fd][ee][ef][eg][eh][fh][gh][hh][ih][ii]C[To begin, let's look at this very contrived endgame position.

The first question to ask is, in general, what order should moves be played in the endgame?]
;C[A very logical way to answer that question would be, play the largest move.

In order to do so, we'll first need to know how to value moves.]
;C[Let's figure out how many points are on the upper side.]
;CR[ea]AB[ea]C[If it is blacks turn, he would play here, reducing white by 1.]
;CR[fa]AE[ea]AW[fa]C[If it were white's turn, he would play here, reducing black by 1 point.]
;AE[fa]TR[ea][fa]C[For the time being, we could call playing in this area a 2 point move since that would be how many points would swing.]
;C[Let's evaluate the bottom.]
;CR[ei]AE[fi][gi][hi]AB[ei]C[If black plays first, he captures 3 stones and gets 3 points of territory for a total of 6 points gained.]
;CR[ei]AW[ei][fi][gi][hi]C[If white plays first, he protects the 3 stones from being captured.]
;AE[ei]C[The value of the bottom could be counted as 6 points.]
;LB[ea:A][ei:B]C[So with that in mind, the practical question here is: assuming there is no komi and it is black's move, where should he play?

With the theory we've been building on the previous slides we should play at "B".]
;AE[fi][gi][hi]AW[ea][fa]AB[ga][gb][ei]LB[ea:4][fa:2][ga:3][gb:5][ei:1]C[If the game plays out like this, white wins by 2 points!]
;AE[ea][fa][ga][gb][ei]AW[fi][gi][hi]C[Let's look at the other variation to see if black had a chance.]
;AE[fi][gi][hi]AW[da][db]AB[ea][fa][ei]LB[da:2][ea:1][fa:3][db:4][ei:5]C[In this case, black wins by 2!

So what was the difference?]
;AE[da][ea][fa][db][ei]AW[fi][gi][hi]C[The key is that when we were looking at the board, we did not consider that, after playing a move, the board position changes.  That is, our evaluation of the biggest move on the board for ourselves may have been correct but after playing a move, the board has changed for our opponent.]
;CR[ea]AB[ea]C[When black plays this move, how will white evaluate the value of this area?]
;CR[da]AW[da]TR[db]C[Well, if white were to get a move here, it would look like this.  White would eventually have to fill the marked point.  Let's call this position 0 points for white.]
;AE[da]C[What happens if black gets another move?]
;CR[ca]AB[ca]C[Black could followup with something like this.]
;AW[ab][bb][db][bc][cc]AB[ba][da][fa][cb]LB[ba:6][da:2][fa:8][ab:7][bb:3][cb:4][db:1][bc:9][cc:5]C[White's best defense looks something like this.]
;TR[da][db]C[The two points from the earlier white variation are marked.

So how many points did white lose?]
;TR[aa][ba][ca][ab][bb][cb][bc][cc]C[White lost 8 points here.]
;CR[ea]AE[ba][ca][da][fa][ab][bb][cb][db][bc][cc]C[In other words, when black plays this move and it is white's turn to evaluate, he'll see that the top side is worth far more than the 6 points at the bottom.

We can revise our calculation of the "biggest move" to mean, the number of points on the board plus the size of the followup.

Here, we can see for black that the top move is worth 2 points with an 8 point followup while the bottom is worth 6 points with 0 points of followup.

When evaluating endgame moves, you should always consider how big your followup is.]
;AE[ea]C[Another topic in endgame which is very important is sente and gote.

I've intentionally skipped this part in order to explain basic valuing of moves, but the idea is central to an effective endgame.

In a nutshell, a sente move is a move which keeps the initiative.  Using the vocabulary we've developed so far, it is playing a move with a big enough followup for the entire sequence such that your opponent has to respond each time.]
;AW[da][db]AB[ea][fa]LB[da:2][ea:1][fa:3][db:4]C[Notice that after this sequence, it is still black's turn to move.

We call move 1 sente.]
;AE[da][ea][fa][db][fi][gi][hi]AB[ei]LB[ei:1]C[However here, black 1 is gote since white does not need to respond.]
;AE[eb][fb][ec][fc][ed][fd][ee][ef][eg][fh][gh][hh][ih][di][ei][ii]AW[da][db][dc][eh]AB[ca][cb][cc][cd][ce][cf][cg][ch][dh]C[Let's look at a few common endgame positions now.

If it is black's turn, he has a few tricks up his sleeve if white is not paying attention.]
;CR[ei]AB[ei]C[The first move is here.]
;AW[fi]TR[fh]C[If white blocks here, black can cut.]
;AE[ei]AW[di]AB[eg][fh]LB[eg:3][fh:1][di:2]C[Black creates a very favorable ko.]
;AE[eg]AW[fh][gh][gi]AB[di][ei][fi]LB[fh:1][gh:5][di:4][fi:2][gi:3]C[In order to avoid this, white should play like so.]
;AE[dh][eh][fh][gh][di][ei][fi][gi]TR[dh][eh][di][ei][fi]C[Let's look at another position.

Here, there are many possible moves for black.  In different situations, they all might be valid.  Today, we'll look at one of those moves.]
;CR[fi]AB[fi]TR[ch]C[This move is called the monkey jump.  I'm not sure what monkeys have to do with this.

The reason for singling out this one over the others is that it is the furthest you can go from the triangle marked black stone.]
;CR[gh]AW[gh]C[White's defense might look something like this.]
;AW[hi]AB[gi]LB[gi:1][hi:2]TR[hh]C[Here are the next moves.

White 2 is possible because black cannot cut without being disconnected.]
;AW[ff][dh][fh][di]AB[eg][eh][hh][ei]LB[ff:7][dh:6][eh:5][fh:2][hh:1][di:4][ei:3]C[Black is disconnected.]
;AE[ff][eg][dh][eh][fh][di]AW[hh]LB[hh:2][ei:1]C[So black pulls back and white protects.]
;C[There are other defenses to the monkey jump possible, but the most important thing is to try to read it out if you encounter it in a game.]
;AE[ca][da][cb][db][cc][dc][cd][dd][ce][de][cf][df][cg][dg][ch][gh][hh][ei][fi][gi][hi]C[That's it for now!

Next week we'll look at the game of go (yep, I haven't finished planning...)])
