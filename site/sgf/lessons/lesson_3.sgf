C[In today's lesson, we will look at the last two pieces (ko and territory) required to play a real game from start to finish.  We will also look at some more life and death situations.

1. Territory
2. False eyes
3. Ko

We can learn the basics of these topics in one lesson, but understanding all the subtleties could take many years.]
;AW[fa][fb][fc][gc][hc][ic][fd][ee][fe][ef][eg][eh][ei]AB[ea][eb][cc][ec][dd][ed][de][df][dg][dh][di]C[So, what does it mean to "have territory"?

The oversimplified answer is, territory is the empty spaces that one player surrounds completely.  In this case, we have black's left side totalling 29 points, white's top right has 6 points and the bottom right has 22 points.  If there were no captures in this game, the score would be 29 to 28 in favor of black.

In order to answer this question more completely, we'll have to look at how a game ends.]
;C[In go, there are a few ways a game ends.

1. One player resigns.  The other player wins.
2. One player runs out of time.  The other player wins.
3. Both players pass consecutively.  Score is calculated by summing the number of captures with the amount of territory.

Of course, what we're interested in is the third case.]
;AB[cb]TR[cb]C[The first question that comes out of this is, why would a player ever pass?  

Well, let's say we are playing black.  If it is our turn and we play the marked move, what will happen?

If we do this, the score now becomes 28-28 and we've thrown away the victory.  This would result in a tie game should both players pass at this point.  In Japanese, this is called "jigo".]
;AE[cb]AB[hb]TR[hb]C[If we play in white's small corner, notice that we don't have enough space to make the two eyes needed to be alive.  Also, we don't have any way to kill the white stones.  At the end of the game, the marked stone is recognized to be dead and removed from the board as a prisoner.

In this case, we have thrown away a stone.  White did not need to answer because there was no threat of making 2 eyes.  Should the game end here, the score would be 29 points of territory for black, 28 points of territory for white and 1 capture.  Again, this would be jigo.]
;AE[hb]AB[hh]TR[hh]C[What if black plays here?

The idea is, if black manages to make a live group (that is, a group with two eyes), white's territory will be destroyed.]
;AB[hg][ig][gh][gi][ii]TR[ih][hi]C[For example, if white ignores black's invasion, he might make a shape like this.

Since black is unconditionally alive here, the bottom right side is no longer white's territory.  In fact, black gains 2 points of territory here in the process of living.

This outcome is something that white cannot allow to happen.]
;AE[ig][gi][ii]AW[hf][hg][fi]AB[fh]LB[hf:2][hg:4][fh:5][gh:3][hh:1][fi:6]C[Here, white successfully prevents black from forming two eyes.  What is the score now?

Well, black's territory count remains at 29.  The top right remains at 6.  The 3 black stones are removed from the bottom right as captured stones leaving white with 19 points of territory.  White's point total would be 6 points (from the top) + 19 points (from the bottom) + 3 points (from captures) = 28 points.

The moral of this is, if you play in your opponents territory and they respond, no points are gained in either side if the invasion fails.  However, if your oppponent does not respond and you fail to live, you are giving captured stones to your opponent.]
;AE[hc][ic][de][eg][eh][fh][gh][di][ei][fi]AW[ga][ac][ec][ad][bd][dd][ed][hd][ce][ge][af][bf][cf][df][if][ag][bg][ig][ah][dh]AB[ba][fa][ab][db][bc][dc][ee][fe][ef][gf][cg][fg][hg][bh][ch][ih][ai][bi]C[Here's a bit of practice!

This is a modified game that was played by two professionals - Cho Chikun 9d (taking white) and Yamada Wakio 9d (taking black).  At this point of the game, both players have passed and its time to count score.

Can you determine which is black's territory and which is white's?]
;TR[aa][ca][da][bb][cb][ff][eg][gg][dh][eh][fh][gh][ci][di][ei][fi][gi][hi][ii]C[The marked area is black's territory.  I count 19 points.]
;TR[ha][ia][gb][hb][ib][hc][ic][gd][id][ae][be][he][ie]C[And this is white's territory.  I count 13 points.]
;TR[cd][de]C[The marked points here are neutral points.  They are not worth anything to either player.  We call them "dame" (dah-meh).]
;C[There were 2 black prisoners and 1 white prisoner from earlier in the game.

Also, there is a white prisoner on the board.

In an even game, it is recognized that going second is a handicap.  For that reason, white is awarded "komi", or compensation, for going second.  In this game, komi was 6.5 points.

Our total looks like this:
White: 13 points of territory + 2 captures + 6.5 komi = 21.5 points
Black: 19 points of territory + 2 capture = 21 points

White wins the game by 0.5 points.]
;C[If we were playing a game on a real board and wanted to score the board, we would do the following.

1. Fill the dame.
2. Remove prisoners that are on the board.
3. Fill in the territory with the prisoners of the same color (more on this in a later slide).
4. Move the stones within their respective territories as necessary so the game is easier to count.]
;AW[de]AB[cd]LB[cd:1][de:2]C[1. Fill the dame.

We fill in the neutral points so there is no confusion.]
;TR[dh]C[2. Remove any prisoners that are on the board.

We will keep this with the other captures from the game.]
;AE[dh]AW[ib][ic]AB[ei][fi]LB[ib:1][ic:2][ei:1][fi:2]C[3. Fill in the territory with prisoners of the same color.

The reason we can do this is because we do not actually care about the point total of either player.  We only care about the difference in points between the two players.

If, for example, we were to think about a black prisoner, we would say white gets +1 point of capture for it.  If we were take that stone and instead put it in black's territory, it would count as -1 for black's territory because there is one less empty space.

In this game, there were 2 prisoners for either side.  We can place them anywhere in the territory.]
;AE[ba][db][ib][ic][hd][dg][fg][ei][fi]AW[gb][gd][be]AB[bb][cb][ff][ci][hi][ii]TR[dg]C[4. Move the stones around so that the game is easier to count.

Notice that moving stones within a territory does not affect the size of the territory

Also, at this stage of the game, we are just counting score.  Though the marked position has a white stone exposed, we know that the bottom territory is black's territory.]
;C[So, what is the result?

White: 11 points + 6.5 komi = 17.5 points
Black: 17 points

Same as our counting before, white wins by 0.5 points.]
;AE[ea][fa][ga][ab][bb][cb][eb][fb][gb][ac][bc][ad][de][fe][af][if][ag][hg][ig][ah][bh][ch][hh][ih][ai][bi][ci][hi][ii]AW[cc][dc][hc][hd][he][cg][dg][eg][fg][gg]AB[dd][fd][gd][ce][ge][cf][df]TR[de][fe]C[Now that we know when a game ends, we only need to know one more thing before we fully understand all the rules to the game and can play from start to finish.

Before we do that, however, we'll revisit some old topics about life and death.  We'll start with what it means to be alive.  We know this shape is alive because it has two eyes.  In the first class, we also talked about when this shape breaks down.]
;AW[gf]TR[gf]C[For instance, if we make a quick swap of the marked stone from white to black, all of a sudden, we see that white can now play in black's would-be eye.]
;AE[fd][gd][ge]AW[fe]C[We call this a false eye.]
;AE[ec][bd][cd][be][ce][he][bf][cf][df][ef][ff][gf][hf][dg][eg][fg][gg]AW[ca][da][ea][fa][ga][cb][dd][gd][id][de][ee][ge][ah][bh][ch][bi][di]AB[ha][ia][db][eb][fb][gb][ib][dc][fc][hc][ic][ed][fd][ag][bg][cg][dh][eh]C[Here are a couple other positions which have false eyes.  Can you find them?]
;TR[hb][ci]C[The marked spots are it!]
;AE[ca][da][ea][fa][ga][ha][ia][cb][gb][ib][dc][hc][ic][ed][hd][id][fe][ag][bg][cg][ah][bh][ch][dh][eh][bi][di]AW[ec][fc][fd][ff][gf]AB[cc][gc][cd][gd][ce][he][cf][df][hf][eg][fg][gg]C[Now here are a few practice problems.  Since I'm working with a smaller board today, I'll do one per page.

Hint for all the problems: Find the false eye!

Directions for all the problems: Black to play.  Kill all the white stones.

To do that, we'll start with one of the first positions we looked at in lesson 1.  Here, white can capture black in one move.]
;AB[ec][dd][fd]C[If we were to modify this position to look like this, what would result?]
;TR[ee]C[If it is white's turn, he could capture the marked stone.]
;AE[ee]AW[ed]TR[ed]C[Now that it's black's turn, according to the rules we've learned so far, he can capture the marked white stone.]
;AE[ed]AB[ee]C[However, this is problematic.  We're right back to where we started.

The rule of ko states, if one player captures the ko, the opponent is prohibited from recapturing the ko immediately.

This is to break the potential for an infinite cycle.]
;AE[ee]AW[ed]AB[ge]LB[ed:1][ge:2]TR[ee]C[The idea is, after white 1, black is not allowed to play the marked move.  He must play somewhere else (like black 2 in this case).]
;AE[ec][ge]AW[dd][fd]AB[eb][dc][fc][ed][ee]C[Notice that ko is a situation that involves a one stone capture and a one stone recapture.  In other words, the following sequence is NOT a ko.]
;AE[ed][ee]AW[ec]
;AE[ec]AB[ed]C[Not a ko situation.]
;AE[eb][dc][fc][dd][ed][fd][de][fe][ef]AW[fh][ei][gi]AB[eh][di]TR[ei][fi]C[Also, notice that ko can happen on the edges of the boards.]
;AE[eh][fh][di][ei]AW[ig][hh][ii]AB[gi][hi]TR[ih][ii]C[The corner is also a place that has the potential for ko.]
