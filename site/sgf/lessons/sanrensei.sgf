C[Hello!

This lesson is a continuation of the fuseki lesson.  You should check it out to make sure you understand all the fundamental concepts before looking at this one.

There are many different kinds of openings in go.  Perhaps one of the more popular ones among amateurs is called "sanrensei".  Sanrensei translates to "three stars in a row".  In go, this means the star points.]
;AB[pd][pj][pp]C[Let's look at the basic pattern.

The basic idea is to get your stones looking something like this.]
;AW[dd][dp]LB[dd:4][pd:1][pj:5][dp:2][pp:3]C[The order of moves might look something like this.]
;AE[dd]AW[pj]LB[pd:1][pj:4][dp:2][pp:3]C[Before we continue, you may be asking, what if white does not play along?

The answer is he does not have to.

The first moves might look like this.  White 4 prevents the sanrensei pattern.]
;AW[jd]AB[dd]LB[dd:1][jd:2]C[Black 1 tries again to make the sanrensei pattern, but white 2 prevents that from happening.

The point of showing this is just to say, if you don't want to play against a particular opening, you can typically prevent it.

Back to sanrensei...]
;AE[jd]AW[dd]AB[pj]LB[pd:4][qd:3][rd:2][sd:1]C[Now that we've seen the pattern, we'll look into the reasoning behind playing sanrensei.

The first thing to notice is that each black stone is on the 4th line.

In the opening, there is typically a distinction between 3rd and 4th line moves.]
;C[The 4th line is typically regarded as the "line of influence" while the 3rd line is typically called the "line of territory".

Let's take a look into what that means.]
;AE[dd][pd][pj][dp][pp]AB[hq][kq]LB[hq:3][hr:2][hs:1]C[To start, let's look at some stones on the third line.]
;TR[ir][jr][is][js]C[The idea is that it is difficult for an opponent to invade and live in the marked area, so we can think of the area under them, tentatively, as territory.]
;AE[hq][kq]AB[hp][kp]TR[iq][jq][ir][jr][is][js]C[The fourth line, on the other hand, has more space available making a successful invasion more likely.]
;C[That said, because the stones are "higher", they will have more influence on the game.

Influence is often a harder concept to grasp.  We won't be able to go into all the subtleties in this lesson (in fact, it usually takes a player at least a year or two to feel comfortable with what influence means and how to play with it).

We'll try to hit on what we need to know for playing with sanrensei.

When we play an influence-based game, we're typically aiming for one of two things:

Either we are trying to build a huge territorial framework or we are attacking our opponent.]
;AE[hp][kp]AW[nb][nc][pc][qc][dd][dp]AB[lc][od][pd][qd][me][pj][pp]TR[lc][od][pd][qd][me][pj][pp]C[Going back to sanrensei, this is one normal variation.  Here we see that black has built a large moyo, or territorial framework.  Moyos aren't quite territory because the opponent can often reduce it.  That said, if you can solidify a moyo to points, it can be very big.]
;AW[ph]AB[oi]LB[ph:1][oi:2]C[Because of the strength we gained here, if our opponent tries to invade, we can attack very severely.  For instance, if white invades here, he will have a very difficult time making life.  This is another advantage of influence.  Your opponent needs to be careful not to put themselves in a disadvantageous position.]
;AE[ph][oi]LB[nb:7][lc:2][nc:1][pc:5][qc:3][od:6][qd:4][me:8]C[With all that said about influence though, this is a very standard opening when black plays sanrensei.

The reason why is because white manages to get a settled group in the top right and he has sente.]
;AW[jp]LB[jp:1]C[White's next move can be something like this to try to negate some of the effect of black's moyo.]
;AE[nb][lc][nc][pc][qc][od][qd][me][jp]C[Now, you may be thinking, what if white decides to fight influence directly with influence by playing on the star points?]
;AW[dj][jp]AB[jd][jj]LB[jd:2][dj:1][jj:4][jp:3]C[The idea is fairly simple.  There are only 9 star points.  White will only get 4 while black gets 5.  It's true that it is now white's turn, but it's hard to feel like white is not behind.]
;AE[dd][jd][pd][dj][jj][pj][dp][jp][pp]C[That's it for this lesson!

Next week we'll look at shapes.  We'll talk about how we can be efficient in our tactics to be as effective as possible.])
