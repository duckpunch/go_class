C[Today's lesson is going to be about joseki.

The first question to ask is pretty straightforward.  What does joseki mean?

In a sentence, josekis are deeply studied sequences which are generally accepted as balanced for both players.]
;C[The second question is, why would one ever want to study joseki?

I can't speak for anyone but myself, so here are the reasons I study joseki.

The most typical reason that I find myself reading up on joseki is that I get my butt kicked in a game.  If this happens in the opening, there is a good chance that I misplayed a joseki.

The second most common reason that I study joseki is to learn new opening moves to play.  If I play the same opening too often, it can sometimes get tedious.]
;AW[nc][jd][nd][od]AB[oc][pc][qd][qf]LB[nc:4][oc:3][pc:5][jd:8][nd:6][od:2][qd:1][qf:7]C[So, now that we've established roughly what joseki is and why we might study it, let's take a look at one and figure out how we should study it.

If you open up a joseki dictionary, you might get something that looks like this.

In my estimation, studying joseki boils down to 3 steps.

1. Understand it.
2. Memorize it.
3. Play it in a game.]
;CR[qd]AE[nc][oc][pc][jd][nd][od][qf]C[The first step is to understand the joseki.  We do this by going through each move.

The first move here is called the 3-4 point.  The idea is similar to what we talked about in the fuseki lesson.  Black is staking out a piece of the corner.  In this case, the emphasis is on the right side.

This move is a very old move.  By that I mean, it has been played for centuries or more.  Many old classics will begin with this corner opening.  This specific move is called "komoku".  I'm not sure if it actually translates to any English word, but I believe the literal translation is something like "little point".

Don't be confused by this.  It's actually a pretty big point :)]
;CR[od]AW[od]C[The next move in this joseki is an approach move or "kakari".  Anytime a move is played near a corner stone of the opposite color, we call it an approach move.

The general idea is that we do not want our opponent to get too strong in that area.]
;CR[oc]AB[oc]TR[pc]C[Black follows up here by protecting the corner.  There is a possibility that white may play the triangle move, but it will end poorly for white.]
;AW[pc]AB[pd]LB[pc:1][pd:2]C[If white decides to cut here, black will cut him back.  This result is not very good for white.]
;CR[nc]AE[pc][pd]AW[nc]C[Because white cannot cut off black, white prevents black from expanding along the side instead.]
;CR[pc]AB[pc]TR[nd]C[With the white's move in place, black must now protect his stone from atari.  This also opens up a cut point at triangle.]
;CR[nd]AW[nd]C[So white protects that point.]
;CR[qf]AB[qf]C[Black extends along the side so as not to be sealed in from both sides.]
;CR[jd]AW[jd]LB[id:A][kd:B]C[White extends along the top side so as not to be easily attacked.  You may ask, why not "A" or "B"?]
;CR[kd]AE[jd]AW[kd]C[Let's take a look at "B" first.  The idea with not playing "B" is that we want to expand as far as possible without any harm to ourself.

So, if we can extend further, we should.]
;CR[id]AE[kd]AW[id]C[So on that note, let's look at "A".  The idea here is that black can now disconnect the white group.]
;AW[jc][kc]AB[lc][kd][ld]LB[jc:4][kc:2][lc:3][kd:1][ld:5]C[Here, black manages to separate the two white groups.  The idea is that by extending too far, white creates an unnecessary weakness for himself.]
;AE[jc][kc][lc][id][kd][ld]AW[jd]C[We should now look at the joseki.  What happens if black tries to disconnect white in the same way?]
;AW[lb][mb][ic][lc][kd]AB[jc][kc][mc][ld][md]LB[lb:6][mb:8][ic:10][jc:9][kc:3][lc:2][mc:5][kd:4][ld:1][md:7]TR[nc][jd][nd][od]C[A sequence like this might play out.  Note that the two triangle marked groups are still connected.]
;AE[lb][mb][ic][jc][kc][lc][mc][kd][ld][md]C[So now that we've gone through and understood each of the moves, the next step is to memorize the sequence.

The important point here, though, is if you do not understand each move, you should not proceed.  There is no point in memorizing a sequence which you do not understand.  Work hard at understanding each and every move and the effort to memorize it afterwards will be trivial.]
;C[The last step is to play it in a game.

In a game, you'll get a chance to see how different people respond to it.  They may deviate from your sequence and you'll get a chance to figure out how to punish them.  Alternatively, they may just be playing a different joseki. 

Either way, you'll see how the sequence evolves over the course of a game.  The more you play a joseki in a game, the more comfortable you will get with it.]
;AE[nc][oc][pc][jd][nd][od][qd][qf]C[That's it!

It's been fun teaching this class.  Thanks and I hope you all keep playing!])
