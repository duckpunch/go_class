C[A game of go is typically broken down into three phases:
1. Fuseki (the opening)
2. Chuuban (the middle game)
3. Yose (the endgame)

This lesson will be about fuseki.]

Black has surrounded 12 points of territory at various parts of the board.]
;C[Notice how many stones it took for black to do so.

In the corner, it took 8 stones.

On the side, it took 12 stones.

In the center, it took 18 stones.]
;C[In general, we say that it is most efficient to form territory in the corner, then the sides, then the center.]

With the notion of efficiency in mind, let's take a look at how a real game might unfold.]
;AW[dd][pq]AB[qd][dp]LB[dd:4][qd:3][dp:1][pq:2]C[Here are the first 4 moves.  Both players stake out a corner - the most efficient place to make territory.]
;AW[po]AB[od]LB[od:1][po:2]C[With the next two moves, both players begin to develop their corners just a bit more.]
;AW[cc][jc][fd]AB[lc][bd][cf][ci]LB[cc:4][jc:6][lc:7][bd:3][fd:2][cf:1][ci:5]C[Black 1 is an approach move on white's corner.  The idea is to not allow white to develop too large of a corner.  In the moves that follow, both players expand to their respective sides.

The reason for this is twofold.  

The next most efficient place to surround territory is the sides.  By extending their position, they are outlining more territory.

The other reason is to create space for life.  Both players are creating a strong position that, if attacked, can make two eyes easily.]
;AW[jp][fq]AB[dn]LB[dn:2][jp:3][fq:1]C[For the same reason as black did in the previous slide, white 1 is played to prevent black's corner from becoming too large.

There is now one last big area on the board.  Can you find it?]
;AW[ql]AB[oj][qj]LB[oj:3][qj:1][ql:2]C[Black 1 is played on the last open side.  White expands his own corner with 2.

Since there are no more large moves in the corners or sides, black jumps to 3.]
;C[We would consider this the end of the opening game.  At this point, each player will evaluate their position.  

If they feel like they're behind, they might try to invade or reduce their opponent's territory.  If they feel they are ahead, they might try to defend what they've staked out.]
