C[Today, we continue to look at ways to apply rules we've already learned.

We'll be looking at what are called "snapbacks".

The basic premise is to capture some stones by reducing your opponents liberties via sacrifice.]
;AW[jj][kj][hk][ik][jl]AB[ji][ki][ij][lj][lk][kl]TR[jj][kj]C[This is a basic snapback position.

The marked stones can be captured by black.

Can you see how?]
;TR[jk][kk]C[Notice there are two liberties for the white stones.  The key to capturing them will be to pick the right first move.]
;AW[jk]AB[kk]LB[jk:2][kk:1]C[If we pick the wrong one, we will just be forcing our opponent to connect.

Let's see what happens in the correct sequence.]
;CR[jk]AE[kk]AB[jk]C[Here, black reduces the white group down to 1 liberty.  To do so, black has put himself in atari.]
;CR[kk]AE[jk]AW[kk]C[If white decides to kill black's stone, notice that white still just has one liberty.]
;CR[jk]AE[jj][kj][kk]AB[jk]C[With black's next move, he can kill white.]
;AE[hk][ik][lk][jl][kl]AW[ki][lj][kk]AB[kj]C[One thing to note about snapbacks is that it is not the same as a ko.

Recall that when we talk about ko, we are talking about trading a single stone each time.  With a snapback, we are typically trading a few stones for much more.]

Here it looks almost as if white has two eyes.  However, black can kill white in a snapback.

Can you find the right sequence?]
;CR[jj]AB[jj]TR[ji][ki][li][mi][mj][jk][kk][lk][mk]C[Black's first move is to reduce white's group down to one liberty.]
;AE[kj]AW[lj]LB[jj:2][lj:1]C[If white kills the black stones, black throws right back in.]
;CR[kj]AE[jj]AW[kj]C[If white captures the throw-in, white is left with one liberty.]
;CR[jj]AE[ji][ki][li][mi][kj][lj][mj][jk][kk][lk][mk]AB[jj]C[And black can capture on the next turn.]
;AE[ih][jh][kh][lh][mh][nh][gi][hi][ii][ni][fj][hj][ij][jj][nj][fk][gk][hk][ik][nk][il][jl][kl][ll][ml][nl]AW[jq][kq][lq][gr][hr][ir][lr][js][ks][ls]AB[ip][jp][kp][lp][mp][fq][gq][hq][mq][fr][jr][mr][gs][is][ms]C[Here's another example.

Can black kill the white group?]
;LB[jj:A][iq:D][fs:B][hs:C]C[Let's look at the candidate moves.

"A" represents tenuki and will represent the correct answer if we believe white is already alive.

First, convince yourself that outside the "B", "C" and "D", there are no other local options that are worthwhile.]
;AE[jr][is]AW[kr][hs]AB[iq][fs]LB[iq:3][kr:4][fs:1][hs:2]C[If we choose "B" first, we see that white lives.]
;CR[hs]AE[iq][kr][fs]AB[jr][hs][is]C[What about "C"?]
;AE[hs][is]AW[fs]LB[fs:1][gs:2]C[White's next move is to capture.

Notice that black cannot make that eye false.]
;AE[jr][gs]AW[kr][hs]AB[iq]LB[iq:2][kr:3][hs:1]TR[jr][is]C[The following sequence gives white 2 eyes so we can cross "C" off the list.]
;AE[iq][kr][fs][hs]AB[jr][gs][is]LB[jj:A][iq:D][fs:B][hs:C]C[The last move to try is "D".]
;CR[iq]AB[iq]LB[kr:F][hs:E]C[Here, there are two possible white responses, "E" and "F"]
;CR[hs]AE[is]AW[hs]TR[is]C[If white plays "E", one of his groups is left with one liberty and black will be able to kill the group.]
;CR[kr]AE[jr][hs]AW[kr]AB[is]TR[jr]C[If white plays "F", he will be in a similar predicament with his other group.]
;AE[kr]AB[jr]C[So in this position, we are looking at a double snapback.

We'll come to a stop here, now that your mind is blown.])
