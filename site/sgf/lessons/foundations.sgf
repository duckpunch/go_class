PW[Shiro]PB[Kuro]C[In this lecture on foundations, we're going to discuss a few important ideas for evaluating a position and deciding where and how to play.

We're going to look at four things:
1) Choosing between "urgent" moves and "big" moves
2) Finding the right "direction" of play
3) Connecting your stones (and disconnecting your opponent's)
4) Trusting yourself and playing the way you want to play]

An "urgent" move is one that relates to the life & death of your stones or your opponent's stones.  A "big" move is one that claims (or attempts to claim) a lot of territory or prevents your opponent from doing so.

We'll look at the reasoning behind the go proverb through this example.
In this diagram, it's White's turn to play.  Two ideas for White are plays at "A" and "B".  Which would you pick?

]PL[W]
;W[kc]LB[kc:A][dj:B]C[You may remember this move from our discussion of openings.  This White move completes the joseki (standard sequence) in the upper right, and it is an urgent move.

However, when White plays at "A", Black has a chance to play around "B" (which is in the largest remaining open area on the board).]
;B[cj]LB[kc:A][cg:1][cj:B][cm:2]C[Black's stone has invaded White's sphere of influence and helped break up the potentially large White territory on the right.

Note that the Black stone is difficult to attack because Black can extend to either "1" or "2" to help build a base (make room to live) on the side, AND Black can also run out into the center.  The variation shows one possible line of play.

Well, Black "B" broke up a large potential White territory, so maybe White is dissatisfied with this result.  What if White had played "B" instead of "A" (played "big" before "urgent")?]
(;AE[kc][cj]LB[kc:A][dj:B]C[Suppose that White chooses to play at "B" now instead of "A".]
;W[dj]LB[kc:A][dj:B]C["B" is a large move - White's influence over the left side has been reinforced significantly.]
;B[kc]LB[kc:A][dj:B]C[Black seizes the opportunity to attack the White stones in the upper right.

The White stones need to live, but Black's move at "A" is crowding their space along the side.]
;W[ne]C[White chooses to escape into the center.]
;B[ke]LB[mf:A]C[Black continues to chase White into the center.  If Black has the chance, Black would like to play around "A" to try to seal White into the upper side.  If Black is successful and White can no longer escape, then Black can play to threaten White's eye space, which will endanger the life of all of White's stones in the upper right.]
;W[ng]C[White prevents Black from sealing White into the upper side.]
;B[pi]C[Black defends the right side.  As the White group escapes, White may have been able to form a base along the right while also invading Black's sphere of influence.]
;W[kg]C[This move helps White into the center and starts a counterattack against the two Black stones.]
;B[gd]LB[kc:A][dj:B]TR[ne][kg][ng]C[Black plays this move to stabilize his group along the top.

We'll stop this variation here.  Bear in mind that this is not the only way play may have gone, but it is reasonable for both sides.  White's stones on the upper side remain weak while Black took profit on the right during the attack.  Black's stones at the top are resilient and not easy to attack.

The key takeaway is that instead of playing one move at "A" to make his group live, White had to play the three moves at TRIANGLE in order to escape.  The escaping stones do not help White build territory or reduce Black's potential.  Moreover, the White group is still not connected to allies nor does it have two eyes, so Black may still be able to attack it later.

White's weak stones on the upper side has simply been a burden.  What if White sacrified those stones instead of running away?  In that case, it would have been illogical for White to play any of those stones to begin with - Black would capture them and have a large area while White would have gained nothing from the sacrifice.]
;AE[pb][kc][nc][qc][gd][ke][ne][qf][kg][ng][pi][dj]LB[nc:A][dd:4][pd:1][dj:B][po:5][cp:2][eq:6][jq:7][pq:3]C[The real problem for White was here (4 moves before the position we were examining).

In this position, none of the stones are under threat, so White is free to play a big move.  White has lots of choices - we looked at White's approach at "A" in the upper right.  "A" is certainly large, but the largest move right now is around "B".  If White decides not to play around "B", that's okay but White needs to stay consistent.  Trouble arose when White abandoned the plan he/she started at "A" in order to change tacks and play "B".

Let's recap what we've discussed.  "Play urgent moves before big moves."  Urgent moves relate to the life & death of your groups or your opponent's groups.  Weak groups often become burdens - the opponent can attack your weak groups while taking territory.

;AE[po][cp][eq][jq][pq]AW[dp]AB[pj][pp]LB[dd:4][pd:1][pj:5][dp:2][pp:3]C[What is direction of play and why is it important?

Direction of play is an idea that refers to where players place stones in order to try to achieve strategic objectives while meeting the tactical requirements of the position.  Often, a player has multiple ways to accomplish a specific task, but only some of those ways will complement that players larger aim.

Finding the right direction of play is important because it is how players' stones work together to achieve important goals.]
;W[qc]LB[pc:A][qd:B]C[Suppose that White invades the upper right corner.  Now, for Black's reply, Black needs to find the correct direction of play that meets his/her overarching objective.

Strategically, Black's sanrensei opening (the three star points on the right side) aims to build influence, which will then be used to either fight, build a moyo (a large area of control - but not quite definitive territory), or take territory.  The arrangements of Black's stones emphasize control of the right side and the center.

Tactically, Black needs to address White's invasion.  The two most common answers to a 3-3 invasion under the star point are "A" and "B".  Which would you choose in this position?]
;B[pc]LB[pc:A][qd:B]C[Suppose Black answers at "A", which prevents White from extending along the top, but White is free to extend along the right.  Let's look at a joseki to see what might happen.]
;W[qd]
;B[qe]
;W[re]
;B[qf]
;W[rf]
;B[qg]
;W[pb]
;B[ob]
;W[qb]
;B[nc]LB[id:A]TR[pj][pp]C[The joseki ends with this move.

Black's wall does not coordinate with his TRIANGLE stones and so the wall does not immediately help make territory or build a moyo.  Black needs to play around "A" to realize the potential value of the wall, but it's White's turn.  So White can play around there first and limit Black's potential on the upper side.

Let's go back to the original position.]
;AE[ob][pb][qb][nc][pc][qd][qe][re][qf][rf][qg]LB[pc:A][qd:B]C[We just saw that if Black blocks at "A", then Black gets a huge wall facing the left along the upper side.  What if Black blocks at "B" instead?]PL[B]
;B[qd]
;W[pc]
;B[oc]
;W[ob]
;B[nc]
;W[nb]
;B[mc]
;W[rd]
;B[re]
;W[rc]
;B[qf]LB[pc:A][qd:B]TR[pj]SQ[qc]C[This is the same joseki, but it faces the bottom instead of the left.

Now Black's wall already has the TRIANGLE stone in a good place to start building a moyo and taking territory.  If White invades, then Black can fight very strongly by using the strength of the wall to pressure the invading stones.  If White just lets Black finish the moyo, then Black will have built an extremely large territory that will be difficult for White to match.  Black is leveraging the stones Black already has in place in order to achieve his/her broader strategic objectives.

So, we can see that between the two options of "A" and "B" in response to White's invasion at the 3-3 point (SQUARE), "B" is the correct direction of play.  It helps Black carry out his/her initial plan (build influence), and it meets the tactical needs of the position.

As an aside, White's initial invasion at 3-3 was too early and consequently wasn't particularly good.  The problem is that it helps Black to strengthen the position on the right side too much at this stage of the game.  Now, White will have to work hard to combat Black's early lead.]
;AE[nb][ob][mc][nc][oc][pc][qc][rc][qd][rd][re][qf][pj]AW[ql][pp]AB[dd][dp]C[We're going to look at a quick example to show the significance of connecting and disconnecting.

Suppose we have this starting position and White decides to approach the Black corner in the upper right.]
;W[qf]
;B[qe]
;W[pf]
;B[qi]C[This Black move is likely to turn out poorly.

The Black stone is already separated from friendly forces, and it doesn't have much room above or below it to form a base along the side.  White now has a good target for attack.  If Black can escape into the center, then White should be able to build strength by harrassing the weak Black stones.]
;W[oi]C[White begins by trying to seal the Black stone off from the center.

If Black lives, then Black will have disrupted White's territory along the the right side.  On the other hand, if White successfully captures the invader, then White will have solidifed the territory along the right side AND will likely have built a wall that may be useful for battles in the center.]
;B[rf]LB[rg:B][dj:A]C[Black attempts to save the invading stone.

If White plays a big point like "A", then Black can play "B" and connect the invading stone to the corner above.]
;W[rg]LB[re:A]C[White prevents the connection and threatens to play atari at "A".]
;B[re]LB[qg:A]C[Black defends the atari and threatens to cut at "A" and possibly rescue the invading stone.]
;W[qg]LB[rf:A][qg:1][rg:2]TR[ph][qh][rh][pi][qi][ri][si][qj][rj][sj][qk][rk][sk]C[White defends the cut and starts to solidify the territory marked by TRIANGLE.  The invading Black stone isn't captured yet, but if it is then White gets the territory on the right side. 

It was White's stones "1" and "2" that disconnected that Black invading stone and made it weak.  Compare that with what might have happened if White played elsewhere in response to Black "A".]
;AE[re][qg][rg]C[Here's the same position as before, White to move.]PL[W]
;W[dj]LB[rg:A]TR[rf]C[Suppose in response to Black TRIANGLE White plays to break up the Black potential on the left side instead of playing at "A".]
;B[rg]TR[ph][qh][rh][pi][qi][ri][si][qj][rj][sj][qk][rk][sk]C[Now Black has connected the the invading stone to a live Black group.

This means that White cannot claim the marked TRIANGLE points as territory.  The difference between connecting versus disconnecting the lone invading Black stone is probably more than 20 points.]
;W[jq]
;B[pj]LB[jq:A]TR[oi][ql]C[On top of that, if White plays elsewhere (at "A", for instance), then Black can start to separate the two White TRIANGLE stones.  Black will start to encroach on White's sphere of influence in the the lower right and will also make it easier in the future to attack either of the two White groups that have been split (Black is not strong enough at the moment to launch a powerful attack against either group, the point is simply that a separated group is an easier target to attack than one that can link to allies).]
;AE[dj][pj][jq]AW[qg][rg]AB[re]TR[rg]C[Once again, here's the situation if White prevents the connection at TRIANGLE.]
;AE[re][qg]AW[dj]AB[rg]TR[rg]C[Here's the situation where Black has connected.

If we focus only on the right side, I hope you can see the difference.  In the first case, the separated Black stone would have had to struggle for life or been sacrificed.  In the second case, the Black stone has become strong and now even threatens to make trouble for the White groups.]
;AE[dd][pd][qe][pf][qf][rf][rg][oi][qi][dj][ql][dp][pp]C[The last point is less about analyzing principles and more about having fun.

When you play go, you're the best resource you've got to decide what you want to do.  If it doesn't work out, that's an opportunity for you to analyze AFTER the game and improve.  If you've got an idea you're not sure about, or you don't know why you should/shouldn't make a particular move, then try it out and see what happens.  That's part of the fun of it all.

So, when you play, trust yourself and your reading, play the way you want to play, and have fun :D])
(;W[cl]
;B[cg]
;W[ce]
;B[ej]LB[fc:D][jd:C][qj:A][jo:B]C[Black has more or less stabilized the stones on the left.  White still has some attacking potential against this group, and Black has some counterattacking potential against the lower left White corner.

The point is that Black's incursion into White's sphere of influence has substantially reduced the amount of territory that White may have been able to form on the left side.  Black's group is strong enough at the moment that Black can leave the situation and look for big moves elsewhere (e.g. some ideas for Black are "A", "B", "C", and "D"), depending on how White plays.]))
