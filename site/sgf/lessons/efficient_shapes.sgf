C[This lecture is on shape.  In particular, how to make shapes which can help us be efficient in tactical positions.

Shapes which are generally regarded as "good" shape shine in at least a few of these three categories:

- Liberties (they have a lot, usually with not very many stones)
- Flexibility (good shapes either have great potential for eyes or move across the board very quickly or both)
- Connection (good shapes are incredibly difficult to disconnect)]
;AB[ii][ji][jj]C[Let's start with this shape.  This is the infamous "empty triangle".

We'll start with connection.  Clearly, this shape is connected.  That said, do we need all 3 stones?]
;AE[ji]TR[ji][ij]C[Notice that this shape is also connected.  Since white does not occupy either of the marked spots, we can think of black as connected.

As far as connection goes, black doesn't need another move.]
;AB[ji]TR[ij]C[This is the reason we call this shape "empty".  If white had a stone in the marked spot, black's shape wouldn't be bad.]
;LB[ih:2][jh:3][hi:1][ki:4][ij:7][kj:5][jk:6]C[The next thing we'll look at is the liberty count.

With 3 stones, we have 7 liberties.

Without context, this doesn't mean much.  We'll keep these numbers in mind for later.]
;TR[hj][ik]C[What about flexibility and eye shape?

At the moment, the only potential black has for eye shape are the marked points.  It would not be particularly hard for white to disrupt the eye shape here.  

Furthermore, this group doesn't take up much of the board.  Everything is clumped together - this group will live or die in its entirety.  This reflects its lack of flexibility.]
;AE[ii][ji][jj]AB[hi][ki][ij]C[Let's take a look at another shape.  We'll start in the same manner with connection.

This shape is obviously less connected than the empty triangle because it is not actually connected.  That said, let's look at the potential for connection.]
;LB[hi:1][ii:B][ji:C][ki:3][hj:A][ij:2][jj:D]C[The plausible moves for disconnection are the letters marked.

Let's look at them in order.]
;AW[hj]TR[ii][ji][jj]C[Note that each of these 3 moves allow the original 3 black stones to stay connected.]
;AW[ii][ji]AB[ih][jj]LB[ih:2][ii:1][ji:3][jj:4]C[Even if black decides not to play, he still has a ladder to stay connected.]
;AE[ih][ji][hj][jj]C[What if white starts here?]
;AW[ji]AB[ih]LB[ih:1][ji:2]TR[jh][jj]C[In this case, black can choose from two different ladders.]
;AW[lf]LB[jh:A]C[This is useful if we can tell that the ladder on one side doesn't work.

For instance here, we would play the ladder starting at A.]
;AE[lf][ih][ii]C[This white move to try to disconnect is a bit easier to handle.]
;AB[jj]LB[jh:A][jj:1][kj:B]C[If black plays 1, A and B are miai for connection.]
;AW[jj]AB[ji]LB[ji:2][jj:1]C[If white plays 1 here, black can connect with 2.]
;AE[ji][jj]LB[hh:2][kh:5][gi:1][ii:3][ji:4][li:6][hj:10][jj:8][kj:7][ik:9]C[So, we've established that black is fairly connected here.

Let's look at the liberty count.  Recall the empty triangle made 7 liberties with 3 stones.

This shape is making 10 liberties with 3 stones - a far superior liberty per stone ratio.]
;C[Now let's look at flexibility.

This group is covering a larger area on the board and since the stones are not completely connected, it is open to strategies which involve sacrifices.  This is a bit of a strange notion in go.  You want to strive for connection, but you don't want to be overconcentrated because it makes your stones less efficient.]
;TR[jg][ih][jh][ji][gj][hk]C[How about eye shape?

Black has the marked moves and perhaps much more in terms of developing eyes.]
;AE[hi][ki][ij]AB[fi][gi][ni][fj][gj][mj]C[So that was the short lesson on comparing good shape with bad shape.

The last tidbit I want to mention is if you add stones to a bad shape, it will still be a bad shape.

If you take away stones from a good shape, it will still be good shape.

For example, the shape on the left is the original empty triangle with an extra stone - terrible shape.

The shape on the right is the good shape we saw with one stone removed - still good shape.])
