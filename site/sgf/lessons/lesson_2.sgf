C[Last week we looked at what it means for a go stone to actually be captured.

This lesson will be about some more advanced techniques on capturing stones.

We will cover the following common situations that come up in real games:
1. Dead ends
2. Tunnels
3. Double atari
4. Nets
5. Ladders]
;AW[jj][jk]AB[ij][kj][ik][kk][jl]C[In the last class, we looked at positions like these.  Here, white is about to be captured.]
;AW[ji]C[However, if he adds another move, he can escape.]
;AE[ji][ij][jj][kj][ik][jk][kk][jl]AW[fs][gs]AB[fr][gr][hs]C[We'll start this lesson with what we're going to call "deadend".  This isn't one of those fancy official terms, just what I've heard other teachers call it.

In this position, even if white adds more stones to his group, it will eventually die.]
;AW[as][bs][cs][ds][es]AB[br][cr][dr][er]LB[br:8][cr:6][dr:4][er:2][as:9][bs:7][cs:5][ds:3][es:1]TR[ar]C[The reason for the name "deadend" is that, even if white focuses on escaping with this group, it will inevitably be captured.]
;AE[as][bs][cs][ds][es][fs][gs]AB[ar]
;AE[ar][br][cr][dr][er]AW[es][fs][gs]LB[er:1][ds:2]TR[es]C[This leads us to the next capturing technique.  

In the case of the deadend, we saw that each time white added a stone to the board, the group gained a liberty (until the very last move).

This does not always happen!  Sometimes, even if you add extra moves to the board, you may not gain any liberties.]
;AE[es]AB[er]C[Like the "deadend" this technique lacks a proper name.  So we'll call it a "tunnel".

You can imagine it as if you were in a tunnel.  Either side could be closed off and you wouldn't be able to get out.  The analogy here would be that the white group is currently in a tunnel and even if stones are added, black can cut off the end.]
;AW[es]LB[es:1]TR[ds]C[Still just one liberty.]
;AE[er][fr][es][fs]AW[dq][eq][fq][gr]AB[ep][fp][gp][gq][hr]TR[gr][gs]C[Sometimes, positions arise where a tunnel can be formed to capture groups.

White's marked group only has 2 liberties.

Can you see where black could move here to create a tunnel to capture white's group?]
;AB[fr]TR[fr]C[If you picked the marked move, you got it!]

Can you find the move black should play to capture the two marked stones?]

It is black's turn on all 4 problems and the goal is to capture the marked white stones.

Recall that if a group is "in atari" means that it only has one liberty remaining.  Here, we would say the marked black stone is in atari.]
;AE[jk]AW[ji]AB[ki][kj][ik]C[The new technique we are going to look at is called "double atari".  Here, black has a move which will create two ataris, thus guaranteeing that a white stone is captured.

Can you find it?]
;AB[ii]TR[ji][ij]C[This is it!

White can try to escape with either of the marked stones, but he will not be able to save both.]

This position is the basic setup for the "net".  Black has a move that simultaneously creates 2 tunnels on the marked white stone.

The idea is that we can create a deadend to capture the two marked stones from the middle of the board!]
;LB[ih:1][ji:2]C[The first thing we will look at is the number of liberties the white group has.

If black is to play next with the intent to kill the white group, we'll want to take one of those liberties.]
;AB[ih]C[If black plays here, white will be reduced to 1 liberty.]
;AW[ji]LB[jh:1][ki:2][jj:3]C[However, white's next move gives him 3 total liberties.  No matter what we do now as black, we won't be able to reduce white back down to 1 liberty!]
;AE[ih]AB[ji]C[If we look at the other possible move, we'll see that it also reduces the white group down to 1 liberty.]
;AW[ih]LB[ig:1][jh:2]C[This time, though, when white runs, he is left with only 2 liberties instead of 3.]

White will eventually run into a deadend.

I'm sure the biggest thought in your mind at the moment must be "this doesn't look like a ladder!".  I agree.  It looks more like stairs.]

Can you see what will happen here if black tries to capture the marked white stones?

You can try visualizing the stones on the board and follow the ladder up to the floating white stone.]
;AW[jj][ik][jk]AB[ji][ij][kk][jl]C[Can you see now what will happen?]
;AW[ki][kj]AB[lj]LB[kh:1][lh:2][mi:3]TR[li]C[All of a sudden, the extra white stone provides the whole white group more liberties!

Now the white group has 3 liberties and can escape.

What's more is, since black can no longer kill the white group, his position is riddled with weaknesses.

Can you find them?]
;TR[ii][hj][lk][kl]C[Each of the marked positions are possible double ataris.  Black's attack has failed and his overall position has collapsed.]
;AE[ji][ki][li][ij][jj][kj][lj][hk][ik][jk][kk][gl][hl][il][jl][hm][im]C[The two main takeaways for this lesson are that, if you ever find yourself in a position to capture your opponents stones in a ladder or a net or what have you, you can do it!  Alternatively, and perhaps more importantly, if you find your stones facing a deadend or stuck in a tunnel, don't keep playing in that area since you're sure to be captured!]
