C[Today's lesson is all about shape.

We'll look at several common shapes and try to figure out if they are alive or dead.]
;AW[ii][ji][ij][kj][ik][jk][kk]AB[ih][jh][hi][ki][hj][lj][hk][lk][il][jl][kl]TR[jj]C[Recall this shape.  Here, white is dead because he only has one eye.

What if the eye was bigger?]
;AE[kj]AW[ki][lj][lk]AB[kh][li][mj][mk][ll]TR[jj][kj]C[With 2 spaces inside, can you see why white is still considered dead with only 1 eye?

The idea is that there is no way for white to make his inside liberties turn into 2 eyes to find life.]
;AE[ij]AW[hi][hj][hk]AB[hh][gi][gj][gk][hl]C[How about 3 internal liberties?  In this case, it depends on who goes first.]
;AW[jj]C[If it is white's turn, he can create two eyes.]
;AB[jj]C[If it is black's turn, white is in trouble.]
;AW[kj]C[If it is white's turn and he plays inside, he is left with only 1 liberty.]
;AE[hi][ii][ji][ki][hj][kj][lj][hk][ik][jk][kk][lk]AB[ij]
;AE[ij]AW[hi][ii][ji][ki][hj][lj][hk][ik][jk][kk][lk]C[If white passes or plays away, notice that white currently only has 2 liberties.]
;AB[kj]C[Now white is down to 1.]
;AE[jj][kj]AW[ij]C[Now it is back to the shape we know to be 1 eye and dead.

We'll call this 3-in-a-row position "conditionally alive".  The "condition" being who goes first.]
;AE[gi][ji][gj][gk][hl]AW[ih][jh][kh]AB[ig][jg][kg][lh][hi][hj][hk]C[How about this version of 3 internal liberties?

Can you find the key point here?]
;TR[jj]C[This is it!  White will live or die depending on who plays first.  This shape is also conditionally alive.]
;AE[ki]AW[li]AB[mi]C[Let's look at some shapes with 4 internal liberties.  This one is called "box 4".  Can you figure out what it's status is?]
;AW[ki]TR[ki]C[If it is white's turn, notice that anywhere he plays creates the the group of 3 we already looked at.  Now that it is black's turn, white is dead.

This means the "box 4" is dead shape.]
;AE[ij]AW[hi][hj]AB[hg][mh][gi][gj][gk]C[Can you find the key point with this shape?]
;TR[jj]C[This is it!  The white shape is conditionally alive.]
;AE[ii]AW[ij]C[Can you determine the status of this shape?]
;LB[ji:A][jj:B]C[It's alive!

We call the two key points here "miai".  The idea is, if black takes one of those points, white can take the other to live.

In go, miai typically represents 2 key points that accomplish the same thing.  In terms of life and death, we might say something like, "this white group is alive in miai".

Miai is a Japanese word that loosely translates to "arranged marriage".  I'm not sure what that has to do with go...]

;AE[hg][ig][jg][kg][hj][ij][jj]AW[ii][gj][gk][hk]AB[ih][jh][kh][fj][fk][gl][hl]C[4 in a row is also alive.

Can you find the miai points?]
;LB[ij:A][jj:B]C[Here it is!  Try to imagine the miai points with a black and white stone occupying A and B.]
;AE[ii][fj][fk]AW[hh][ih][hj]AB[hg][ig][gh][gj][gk]C[This shape is called the "bent 4".

Can you figure out the status?]
;LB[ij:A][jj:B]C[Alive in miai!]
;AE[hg][ig][gh][hh][ih][jh][kh][lh][mh][gi][hi][ji][ki][li][mi][gj][hj][lj][mj][gk][hk][ik][jk][kk][lk][mk][gl][hl][il][jl][kl][ll]AW[da][bb][cb][db][ac][bc]AB[ea][eb][cc][dc][ec][ad][bd][cd]C[The interesting thing about this shape is what happens when it is in the corner.

Can you determine the status of "bent 4 in the corner"?]
;AW[ba]C[If white goes first, we can see that the shape is alive.]
;AE[ba]LB[aa:2][ba:3][ca:4][ab:1]C[Let's see what happens when black goes first.

There are 4 possibilities.

Notice that possibility 1, 2 and 4 would not prevent white from making the move from the previous slide.  You can try for yourself to see that white lives in those cases.]
;AB[ba]C[Let's see what happens when black plays 3.

Can you see a move that would help white get 2 eyes?]
;AW[aa]C[White's best bet is to play here.]
;AE[aa]AB[ab]TR[aa]C[Now we have a ko!

The result is, the bent 4 in the corner is a ko.]

Can you determine the status of it?]
;TR[kk]C[Conditionally alive!]
;AE[ji][ij][nj][mk][nk][ml][nl]AW[ih][jh][kh][hi][hj][hk][kk]AB[hg][ig][jg][kg][hh][gi][gj][mj][gk][lk][gl][ll]C[How about this one?]
;TR[jj]C[Also conditionally alive!

You can probably imagine that there are many other shapes that 5 internal liberties can take.  The two that we've seen, the bulky 5 and this one, are the only ones that have the quality that they might be killed.

Try arranging some yourself to see!]
;AE[ik]AW[hl]AB[hm]TR[ji][kj]C[Of the different shapes that you can make having 6 internal liberties, this is the only shape that can be killed.  We call this shape "rabbity 6" - I guess the two marked points are the ears...

Can you find the key point to this shape?]
;TR[jj]C[This is it!

The rabbity 6 is conditionally alive.]
