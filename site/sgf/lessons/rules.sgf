C[Go is played with two players, black and white, alternating moves which are played at the intersections.  The goal of the game is to collect the most points.  There are two ways to do this.  The first way is by capturing stones.  The second way is by surrounding territory.  We'll look at capturing stones first.]
;AB[jj]LB[ji:1][ij:4][kj:2][jk:3]C[Any stone on the board has what we call liberties.  The idea is that if all the liberties of a stone are occupied by the opposing player, the stone is considered dead and removed from the board.]
;AW[ji][ij][kj]C[For example, white needs one more move to kill the black stone here.]
;AE[jj]AW[jk]C[The stone is removed from the board and white gains 1 point.]
;AE[ij][kj][jk]AB[ji][ki][jj]C[When a liberty position for a stone is occupied by a friendly stone, we say those stones are connected.  In this case, the 3 black stones are all connected to each other.  We call the connected stones a "group".  They will live and die together.]
;LB[jh:1][kh:2][ii:7][li:3][ij:6][kj:4][jk:5]C[In this case, black has 7 liberties since we combine the liberties of all 3 stones.]
;AW[jh][ii][li][ij][kj][jk]C[If white were to try to kill these stones, he would again need to occupy all of black's liberties.

Can you find the move white needs to play to kill black?]
;AE[ji][ki][jj]AW[kh]C[All 3 black stones are now dead and removed from the board.  White gains 3 points in captures here.]
;AE[jh][kh][li]AB[ii][ji][ij][kj][ik][jk][kk]C[Can you count how many liberties this black group has?]
;LB[ih:1][jh:2][hi:11][ki:3][hj:10][jj:12][lj:4][hk:9][lk:5][il:8][jl:7][kl:6]C[If you counted 12, you got it!]
;TR[jj]C[The marked position is what we call an "eye".  White is not allowed to play there at the moment because doing so would be suicide.]
;AW[ih][jh][hi][ki][hj][lj][hk][lk][il][jl][kl]C[However, if white manages to surround all of the other liberties for this black group, white is allowed to play in the eye.]
;AE[ii][ji][ij][kj][ik][jk][kk]AW[jj]C[In other words, if playing a move which, when played, will have no liberties, you must be killing your opponents stones in order to make liberties for yourself.  Otherwise, the move is illegal.]
;AE[ih][jh][hi][lk][il][jl][kl]AB[ii][ji][ki][li][hj][jj][lj][hk][ik][jk][kk]C[In this situation, we say that the black group has two eyes.

Can you identify the liberties for this group?]
;AW[ih][jh][kh][lh][hi][mi][gj][mj][gk][lk][hl][il][jl][kl]TR[ij][kj]C[Here, even if white manages to surround all the outside liberties of the black group, he would not be allowed to play at either of the marked points since neither of them kills black.

In this case, we say that the black group is unconditionally alive.  There is nothing that white can do to kill them.]
