C[Nice game.  There weren't too many opening related things to comment about as most of the game was very tactical.  That said, when the moment came, both of you found the big areas on the board.  Good job!

The big thing about this game was finding the 3-3 point and getting the timing down to use it.  The basic idea of when to play it is when you can make your opponent inefficient.  That is, if they are thick just outside the corner, the timing might be good to invade.

Conversely, look to defend your 3-3 points in those situations.]

;B[nd]LB[fc:C][og:A][fq:B]C[This move is very defensive for no good reason.  There isn't much the white stone can do.  Alternate moves are marked.

"A" preserves the effectiveness of the black wall.

"B" and "C" are standard corner approach moves.]
;W[jd]C[Big move for white.]
;B[jq]C[Big move for black.]
;W[dj]LB[cq:A]TR[cc][qq]C[Big moves all around!

At this point, the two marked 3-3 points are playable.

The reason "A" is not as good is because white's answer would be too easy.

After this move, white's move should probably be the 3-3 invasion.

;W[qq]C[And the 3-3!

Black should decide at this point whether or not he thinks he can kill white.  If he believes he can, he should obviously do so.  If not, he should look to make as much profit as possible while keeping sente.  Both white 3-3 invasion points are ripe for the taking.
