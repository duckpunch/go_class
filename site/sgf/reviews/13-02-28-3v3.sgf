PW[Steven, David, Lynda]PB[Manjae, Trinh, Geoff]C[Fun game!

In all, I thought both sides found the big areas relatively soon.  The key in most cases was finding the right move in the area.  This can greatly impact the direction the game takes.]

An interesting thing here will be to see how this turns out at the end of the game.]
;W[ik]TR[jj][kj]C[I think white should have extended a bit further here.  Perhaps to either of the marked points.

The idea is, if white plays to here, black can play a deep move in the corner.

(;W[kg]TR[jk]C[In go, there is often an unspoken dialog between both players.  Here, white is saying one of two things to me.  Either you don't care that if triangle lives or you don't care.  In this position, I think white is better off first putting pressure on that stone.
