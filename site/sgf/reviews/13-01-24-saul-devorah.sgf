PW[Saul]PB[Devorah]C[Some interesting back and forth action in this game.

White was definitely quite aggressive in the beginning and left a lot of cutting points.  As black, you must take advantage of this.

That said, black did a great job setting herself up for the win while white had to repair all the cut points.

Keep up the good work!]

;B[ec]TR[gb][be][cf][ef]C[This move is strange.  Alternative moves are marked.

The idea is, you want to play moves that help define your territory or reduce your opponent's territory.]
;W[bd]TR[be][cf][ef][gf]C[This move is perhaps a bit too aggressive.  White is leaving a lot of cutting points in his shape.]
;B[gg]C[When the opponents shape is weak, it is usually better to exploit it by cutting it.

Remember, you should work towards connecting your own stones when possible and disconnecting your opponents.]
