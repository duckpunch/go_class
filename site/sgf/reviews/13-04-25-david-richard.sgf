PW[David]PB[Richard]C[Interesting game!

Most of this review is about fuseki.  In this game, there was a lot of agreement.  Black wanted the sides and the corners while white wanted the center.

A few general note about playing the influence game.

1. You should look to attack your opponent where the opportunity presents itself.
2. Failing that (say if they are really defensive), you should build up a big framework and force them to create a weak group which you can exploit.]

;W[pp]TR[dj]C[It might be good for white to continue his strategy and "disconnect" black here.  Playing the corner here doesn't work well with the first two moves.]
;B[dj]TR[dd][dj][dp]C[Good move for black to take sanrensei here.  It provides a framework for continuity with the marked stones.

White can only focus on attacking the upper right stone now.]
;W[jp]TR[qf][pj]C[Either of the marked moves would be better for black.  I'd prefer the approach move.  The idea with this kind of opening for white is to make black feel uncomfortable.]
;B[pj]
;W[md]TR[qf]C[This move is not aggressive enough for white.  Since white has a lot of help in the middle, the marked move is possible.]
;B[nc]
;W[en]CR[en]C[This is the first white move that indicates to me that white wants to make territory in the center directly.

That is a bad idea.

(;B[dn]C[This move is ok for black, but I think the marked move is a bit better.  It's important to recognize white's intention.  If you play this contact move, you give him the opportunity to build quite a strong wall.

;W[jm]LB[cc:A][qf:C][fp:B]TR[pj][qk]C[It is not clear what this move is doing.  Alternate moves are marked.

"A" takes away some of blacks territory.  This can be effective because any influence black gains here will not be as strong because white already owns the center.

"B" continues to build the framework he is developing on the bottom.

"C" aims to reduce the upper right for black and perhaps stage an attack on the marked black stones.]
;B[qn]C[Good move to reduce white and protect a weak group.]
;W[oe]C[White is still trying to make territory directly in the center.  Black will gain a large advantage if this continues.]
