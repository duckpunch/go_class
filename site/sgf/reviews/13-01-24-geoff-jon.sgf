PW[Geoff]PB[Jon]C[It was nice to see ladders and nets pop up this game.  The takeaway for this game will be noticing a bit earlier when your stones are caught in a ladder and then trying to find moves that use your dead stones to help increase your territory.

Well played!]

;B[dd]TR[ed][fd]C[I think this atari is interesting.  The followup might be to go after the two white stones.]

;B[ef]CR[gc]TR[dc]C[Instead of this move, black can extend at the marked triangle move.  This would threaten to capture the white stones in a net at circle.]
;W[dc]
;B[cd]TR[gc][cf]C[Black should recognize that he is in a ladder here!  Alternative moves are marked.]
;W[cc]
;B[bd]C[White can still capture black.
