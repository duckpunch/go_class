PW[Frank]PB[Trinh]AB[dd][jd][gg][dj][jj]C[There were a few small tactical mistakes and a few strategic mistakes which costed black the game.  That said, I love the way black came at white, unintimidated.  Keep it up!  In my opinion, the most important thing in a handicap game is not to lose your fighting spirit through fear or what have you.

Your overall sense of the board was good, but you should assign a tad bit more value to the corners.  This is not only because it is efficient to make territory there, but also because it is easy to make life there.  In handicap games, you'll often find white trying to make something happen in the corners.

Again, great game.  Keep up the attack!]
