PW[Brian]PB[David]AB[dd][jd][gg][dj][jj]C[Overall, I would say this game is very similar to the other games.  The two major points were connecting and disconnecting and being overly aggressive.

Given that white was played by Brian, a much more experienced player, he was able to take advantage of black's loose shape.]
