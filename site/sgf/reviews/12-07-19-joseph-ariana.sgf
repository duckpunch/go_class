PW[Joseph]PB[Ariana]C[Overall an interesting game.  I went ahead and looked at a few variations in more depth.  Feel free to explore them if you like.  There were a few moves from both players that could have been better, but this game was largely a peaceful one.]

(;B[ae]TR[ff]C[I think this is the first bad move of the game.  B can start trouble by cutting the White stones.  See variation.]
(;W[hc]C[This move is unnecessary at this point.  B is already disconnected.  It might make sense to try to pressure B's territory.]
