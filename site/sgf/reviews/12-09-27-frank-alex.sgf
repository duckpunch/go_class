PW[Frank]PB[Alex]AB[dd][jd][gg][dj][jj]C[Not a bad game Alex!  Definitely good focus for probably one of the longer games you've played.

I included a few comments that are similar to the ones I mentioned in person.  The moral is that you played a really solid game.  Except for a mistake at the end, B was winning throughout and could have come out with a ~20 point win if we didn't run out of time. ]
