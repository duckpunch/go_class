PW[Seth]PB[David]C[I think the main point in this game was about connectivity.  Black had an interesting plan early on, but played a bit loose.  White was able to take advantage and disconnected black.

All in all, nice game!]

;B[je]LB[id:C][kd:D][ie:A][ke:B]C[When black plays this move, the game can quickly become very complicated if white decides to play either 'A' or 'B'.  The nature of black's move is to start a fight.  'A' and 'B' goes along with that plan.  The other option for white is to play solidly at 'C' or 'D'.  Either way white decides to play, he should have a slight advantage.  The simple reason is that he started with a stone in the area first so he will always be one stone ahead.]
;W[gd]TR[kd]C[Playing away gives black the opportunity to gain the upper hand in the corner.  The marked move can threaten to take away white's corner.]
;B[ge]C[This black move signals to me that black wants to make territory in the center.  As we know, that is a difficult place to make big territory since you can be reduced from all sides.

Of course that said, you should always feel free to play moves according to your plan :)]

;B[hl]C[This move goes against black's plan of making territory in the center.]
;W[kh]C[White is doing a good job spreading out his stones.  This may eventually thwart black's plan.]
;B[dg]C[This is not a bad move for black's overall strategy.  The problem is that it leaves an easy cut point for white to take advantage of.]
