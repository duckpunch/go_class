PW[Brian]PB[Bryce]AB[dd][jd][jg][dj][jj]TR[gg][jg]C[Interesting game!

I like that black was picking fights with white through the whole game.  Handicap games are for learning how to fight properly.  Don't be discouraged with the outcome of this game.  There were many very complicated situations, some deliberately created by white, others by black.  I included sequences in some situations that would have lead to more favorable outcomes for black along with some moves that produce simpler games.

The general way to simplify a position is to stay connected.

Normally 5 stone handicaps are played with the marked black stone in the middle of the board.]

(;B[ef]C[This is the first move that is a bit off.  It's usually better to just protect the top side with this move.

;W[de]TR[cd][ee]C[White plays this move to create cut points in black's shape.]
;B[cd]
;W[ee]TR[fc][ef]C[At this point, it is probably better to regard the marked black stone lightly (effectively sacrificing it for now) and play on the upper side.

|See variation;0,1;8|]
(;B[fe]TR[ff]C[This move is not too strong because it creates a cut point.

There is a proverb which states, "You must clench your fist before you punch your opponent".  In essence, black must protect his own weakness before looking to attack white.]

This leads to a pretty complicated fighting sequence.  I'll show what I think would result in the best outcome for black.]
