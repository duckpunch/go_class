PW[Frank and Rebecca]PB[Jon and Charles]C[Good game all around!

I'm not sure what level both of you were at when you came in (this is Frank reviewing), but this game was well beyond the level of an absolute beginner!

The idea in pair go is usually to try to decipher what your teammate is trying to do and try to play in sync with them.  Sometimes you'll be surprised with their moves since it might be different from what you're used to.]
;B[ee]C[Interesting idea.  The thought of this move is to play an influenced based game, emphasizing fighting and the center.]

;W[jd]C[Everything ok so far.]
;B[gi]C[Black continuing with a center-based influence game.]
;W[gc]
;B[dc]C[At this point, it looks like black has a large framework for potential territory.]
;W[ci]TR[dc][ee][gi][dk]C[This forces white to invade before it's too late.

This invasion will be tough with all the black stones around.  White's idea here is to live as quickly as possible.]
;B[dg]TR[cg][cj]C[Pincer is a good idea here.  Normally when an opponent invades, we want to try to restrict their advance in at least one direction.  What we are trying to do is make living uncomfortable.

That said, either marked spot might make white feel more uncomfortable since it either blocks out the possibility of living on the side or corner.]
