PW[Frank]PB[Craig]C[Overall, good game.  Black lost ground in some key spots by playing relatively small moves.  The key is to read whether or not your opponent can actually hurt you.  If they can, then you should defend it accordingly.  If they cannot, you should not play moves there.

If it so happens that your reading is incorrect, don't worry about it.  You may lose the game, but in the grand scheme of things, it is better to always trust your own reading.]

(;B[jh]CR[jh]TR[ki]C[This move isn't bad, but the one thing it doesn't do is prevent white from taking more territory along the corner and side.  For instance, white can take the marked point next.

The alternative to this black move is if black takes the triangle point.

The other possibility is for black to respond to white's move.  Something like 'B' would work.
