PW[Alan]PB[Lily]C[Overall, an impressive game from Lily!  I've had kids much older who were unable to sit through 2 moves let alone an entire game.  Good job!

Solid, safe game by B.  The goal for next time could be to try to take more territory.]

;B[dc]C[I know we haven't talked about this, but in the early game, it's usually important to try to play many stones around the board.  You want to try to have a presence in many different areas.]

(;W[fd]C[Instead of this, there are larger points on the board for both players.  See variation.]

;B[dd]LB[dc:A]C[This move is strange.  Next week (or some future week) we will talk about shape.  The general idea is that we don't want "inefficient" stones.  In this case, for example, we could remove 'A' from the board, and B's position would be very similar.]
