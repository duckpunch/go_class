PW[Jon]PB[Craig]C[Overall, I think this game wasn't as bad as it looked.  It's important for us as we're learning (and we'll always be learning) to try new things and different strategies.

That said, the two main thing in this game was staying connected and not being too aggressive.  Both players played overaggressively but black did it more often in the beginning and paid for it.]

(;B[he]LB[eb:1][gc:4][dd:2][he:5][ef:3]TR[fb]C[This is too aggressive.  It's true that playing this will reduce the white group to two liberties, but black is too fragmented to attack effectively at the moment.  Black has 5 separate black groups trying to surround white, 4 of which have only 2 liberties.

The better play here is to capture the marked white stone.
