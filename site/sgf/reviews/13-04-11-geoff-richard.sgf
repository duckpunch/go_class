PW[Geoff]PB[Richard]C[There were some small moves here and there, but overall the games are looking better!

White had a pretty decent start, but had a misstep which costed the game.

I think part of the lapse in focus may have been due to white having to record the game.  That said, try to internalize the difference between the small moves that were played and the possible big moves that weren't.]

;W[de]C[Good move.  The idea is to split black or press black down.  I like it.]
;B[gg]C[This is an interesting move, but it's perhaps ill-timed.  You are forcing white to split you and you might end up with 3 groups on the board.  This means less efficiency which may end in pain.]
