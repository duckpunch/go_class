PW[Luke]PB[Daniel]C[Well played!

This game started out peacefully until black decided to pick a fight around move 8 or so.  The remaining 40+ moves revolved around that fight.  The main take home for this game is about connecting and disconnecting.

Black did a good job keeping white separated and thus, less efficient.

Overall, strong fighting from both!]

;W[ih]LB[di:A][hi:B]C[Nice.  Note that "A" and "B" are miai for life for white.

Miai means, if your opponent takes one, you can take the other and the result will be the same.  Here, since "A" and "B" are interchangeable in that white will still live, we can say white has miai for life.

Since it's a bit difficult to read, let's |look at what happens;0,1;35| when black decides to ruin white's two eyes at "B".]
