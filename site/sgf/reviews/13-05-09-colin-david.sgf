PW[Colin]PB[David]C[Overall, not a bad game!

There were a couple key points in this game.  Both players had trouble finding the large points on the board.  I tried to point those out over the course of the game.  The second point was that both players seemed to emphasize capturing stones over territory.  Remember that go is about making points.  Most of the time, territory will be bigger than a single capture.]

;B[db]C[This move is too slow.  A move closer to the center would work better.]
;W[ff]
;B[bd]C[Also too slow.]
;W[fe]TR[df]C[This is a strange move for white. The marked point is in the biggest, unclaimed area.]
;B[df]C[Nice.]
;W[dg]C[Good idea here by white.]
;B[bf]TR[db][bd][bf]C[Another strange move by black.  This makes 3 second line moves.  In the opening, even in 9x9, we don't want to play moves on the second line if we can help it.  They tend to have very low potential to surround territory.]
;W[ed]TR[fc][eg]C[A better idea for white might be one of the marked moves.  Since black played slow moves early on, we don't have to worry about falling behind territorially.  It's better for white to just avoid fighting at this point and take the win.]

;B[hi]TR[cc]C[Game ends here.  That said, there are some unresolved points!

The ko on the upper left is worth about 11 points!  Given that there aren't any more ko threats on the board, whichever player takes first will win it! Exclamation point!])
