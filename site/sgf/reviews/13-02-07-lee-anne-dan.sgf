PW[Lee Anne]PB[Dan]C[Well played game.  There were two things I felt could be improved.  The first is in trying to find the biggest points.  This may be reducing the opponents territory or expanding your own.  The upside to this was that I didn't see any moves that had zero or negative value.

The second thing is tactics.  There really isn't anything to do here outside of playing more games and doing problems.]

The left side is wide open.  Black may have considered playing a move there.]

;W[fb]TR[dg]C[This is too soon.  White should focus on building her left side.  There is greater potential for white to build points than to destroy black's territory.  With that said, black's next move should be in the left side area.]
