PW[Richard]PB[Jon]C[I'm not sure who played black and who played white.  I made an educated guess :)

All in all, this was a very solid game.  Often with beginner games, I can't make heads or tails of the moves.  However here, I felt I could understand the motivation for most of the moves.  Going forwards, I would really like to see more 19x19 games out of both of you.

I think one of the big differences in this game was Richard's experience on the big board.

With regards to this review, I started out with a lot of comments, but I think it might be a bit much.

The game itself was very tactical.

I think the big takeaway for black is, watch out for ladders :)

For white, watch out with putting your own stones in ladders.  Also, it seems you often got caught up in the tempo of the fight and forgot to look for the biggest move on the board.  Try to "raise your head" every once in awhile to find the biggest move on the board.  This is very important on 19x19 since the board is actually quite large :)]
