(;B[gb]TR[ha][ia][hb][ib][hc][ic][hd][id]SQ[he]C[B might play a move like this if he were defending territory.  However in this case, the top right is still open for W to come in, so this move doesn't do much in defense.]

(;B[bh]C[Maybe a bit slow here.  I think the game is difficult for B at this point.  Perhaps the best outcome would be just go for as much territory as possible.  See variation.]
