PW[Frank]PB[Richard]AB[dd][jd][pd][dj][jj][pj][dp][jp][pp]C[Great game!  Black played some great moves and sequences throughout!

A few keys for improvement:
- You have good instincts.  Be confident in your own moves!  Often in this game, you played a great sequence, but felt bad about it.  Strange as it might sound, go is as much about strategy and tactics as it is about attitude.
- Look for weak white groups, split them, then attack them.  White played a very loose game here with a handful of errors.  Even if I didn't, a handicap game is to teach you how to fight.  You've already got a lot of the basics down.  Don't be afraid to go after me!]

White's move here is an empty attack.  Black can easily connect.

White group B has not made very many points and does not have strong influence because of black group A.

Black group C has jumped out to the center and white group D is in serious trouble (I decide to sacrifice it later).]
