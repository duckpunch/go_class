PW[David Baum]PB[Sasha]C[Good game overall!

Here are a few summary points.  I've split them as points for Sasha and points for David, but they're pretty general points.

For Sasha:
- Corners are important, but don't be completely focused on them.  Influence is important, too.  This is in reference to the early 2nd line moves you made.
- Always try to pull back after each move and identify the strong and weak groups for both players.  You don't want to get caught up in local fighting, only to see that a group ends up getting surrounded on a large scale and dying.

For David:
- Disrupting your opponent's development can be a good thing, but you must also think about your own development.  There were a couple times in the game where it looks like you opted to limit B's territory instead of develop your own.  You should try to evaluate the relative value of both options and play accordingly.

For both:
- Connections and disconnections!  This is a fundamental notion which applies on both the local and global scales.  If you can connect on the local scale, your stones will be stronger and it will be easier to attack or defend.  On the global scale, if your groups stay connected, you can be more efficient overall.]
