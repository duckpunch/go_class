PW[Jon]PB[Anthony]C[White had control for most of this game until a single missed atari!  We may have to start giving the game recorders a handicap :)

This was a very well played game by both players.  White did a great job in controlling the tempo and black kept fighting in order to come back.  The main focus of this game for black should be to try to focus on the whole board.  For white, it was just a lapse of focus that costed the game.  The rest was very solid.]
