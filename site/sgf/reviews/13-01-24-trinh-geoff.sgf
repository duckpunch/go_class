PW[Trinh]PB[Geoff]C[Solid game overall!

White had some good ideas about loosely surrounding territory and then trying to solidify it.  With some more experience, hopefully we'll be able to see when we need to defend and when we can expand.

Black had some solid tactical reads that kept him in the game.  The point for improvement will be to try to consider the whole board when making decisions.]

;B[dd]TR[eb][gc][ce]C[I think this move is a bit slow.  There is no need to create an eye at the moment.  Black might be better off playing at the other marked points.]

;B[]C[I think I did not mis-record.  White essentially got 2 moves in a row :)

Sorry I didn't catch it as the game recorder!]
