PW[Richard, Trinh]PB[Craig, Anthony]C[Interesting game throughout.  Understanding that this was a pair game, the key takeaway is to try to figure out what your teammate's plan is.  For example, when black was building the big framework, it would have been good to finish it.

There was also that complicated situation in the upper left.  I tried to add some analysis to it without getting too verbose.  Let me know if you have any questions about it.]

;B[gg]LB[ke:B][fi:A]C[Black builds a huge framework and threatens to take the center.  Nice plan.

That said, look out for where you might be reduced before making such a move.  It might still be ok to make the move, but the timing has to be right for it to be effective.

In this case, I would treat the white reduction moves in "A" and "B" as miai.  That is, if white takes one of those, black should take the other.  In this case, if white ignores both, black should take both :)]
;W[cj]C[White emphasizes the corner.  This is ok as well, just be aware that if black manages to actually turn the center into territory, it will be a very difficult game for white.]
