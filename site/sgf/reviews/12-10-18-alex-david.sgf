PW[Alex]PB[David]AB[gc][cg]C[Overall good game.  Lots of ups and downs.

I think the main takeaway is, I like that both of you were aggressive but you have to protect your own stones before you attack.  The proverb for that concept goes something like, in order to punch someone, you must first clench your fist.

The first part probably doesn't have as many comments because I went over that part during class.]
