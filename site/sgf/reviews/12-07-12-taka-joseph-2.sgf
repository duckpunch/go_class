PW[Taka]PB[Joseph]AB[gc][cg]C[Overall, not a bad game.  I think we've found what we need to work on next week - that is, how to find big moves.  B did a good job connecting and staying alive.  Next we need to focus on how to make territory efficiently.]
;W[eh]C[This move is slow.  It does not really threaten anything.  B can just play a big move somewhere.]
;B[df]C[A reasonable move here.  The other options are pretty much anything in the middle.  It is almost as if W passed his first move.]
;W[gg]
(;B[ff]TR[cc]C[Doing this opens the door for W to play at the marked spot.]
;W[cc]
;B[ef]C[No threat of being cut here.  Just play a big move elsewhere.  We will talk about how to find big moves in a future class.]
