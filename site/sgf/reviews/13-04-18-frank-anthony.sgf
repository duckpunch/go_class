PW[Frank]PB[Anthony]AB[dd][jd][gg][dj][jj]C[Nice game overall!  You have a pretty decent sense for fighting.

A few morals in this game:

1. Assign more value to the corners - they're big.
2. Disconnect your opponent more.  White will have a more difficult time if he's less efficient.
3. When attacking, don't create weaknesses that will be exploited.  (The exception here is, of course, if you've read it out and you feel like the attack works, go for it.  You should ALWAYS trust your own reading, no matter what.)]

;W[fc]C[The purpose of my initial moves is to try to get at least a small presence throughout the board.  The idea is that if I focus solely on one side of the board, I will end up losing the game even if I manage to win a battle.]
;B[fe]TR[fc][dg]C[This is a good move.  It is important to keep the two marked white stones separated and to try to connect out from the corner.]

(;B[lh]LB[jd:1][le:2][jg:3][lh:4]TR[jk]C[A better way to play here is to disconnect white.  Notice that with black's move here, he has spent 3 moves trying to kill one stone (4 if you include the handicap stone).  I'm happy with that result as white since I only spent 1 move.
