PW[Seth, Frank]PB[Charmaine, David, Mike]C[Fun game!

The difficult thing about this game was that it became very complicated.  There were many small groups across the board that needed to be juggled.

Playing a game like this can help us with our reading but it's important to understand that not all games have to be like this.  There are often simple variations that can turn out to be better for us and are easier to read.

I think it would be most beneficial at this point to be able to find ways to play a simpler game and work our way up to more complex board positions.  I've included a few places where I think the game could have been simplified and left the rest of the game uncommented.]

;B[hc]TR[fc][hc][dd][jd]C[This is the first move that deliberately tries to make things complex.  This move is not so strong for black because he played into a symmetrical position and it is white's move next.

White can focus on connecting and it would ruin black's plan to complicate the game unnecessarily.

(;W[ck]C[Playing into the corner is a big point, but I think the top area is currently larger.]

;B[ec]TR[hc]C[Instead of this move, black can try to simplify the game by connecting to the marked stone.]
;W[fb]TR[fd]C[As mentioned in review, the marked point is better for white.

The rest of the game is pretty tactical.  I could review it further, but it may be counterproductive.  The remaining review would look like a pretty nasty variation tree.]

(;W[hd]TR[hd]C[Black has a few options from this point, but the point was that white got to play the marked stone first.  If black continues to try to disconnect white, it will not end very well for him.]
