PW[Craig]PB[Brian]C[This is the game we reviewed in class.

Early on, black had a strong lead and a few opportunities to close it out, but white clawed back and turned the game around.  The end result was a white win, but the endgame position had the potential for 2 major sekis which would have made a black win possible!

The thing to work on from this game for white is to think about the whole board before it gets too late.  For black, the key is to work on your fighting and reading.  There were a few instances in this game where white was able to come back due to black miscues.

Exciting game!]
