PW[Saul]PB[Stephanie]C[Overall, I really liked the contrasting strategies in this game.  As we get stronger, we'll get a better idea of the different tools we have at our disposal.  This will lead to even more interesting games.

The one thing that came up a lot in this game is the notion of connecting and disconnecting.  Try to look for moments in your games where you can connect your own stones.  Also, look for ways you can disconnect your opponents stones.]
;B[kj]
;W[ie]C[This move is fine, but understand that you've left a lot of space in the corner for black to live.  In other words, when you play a move like this, you should not expect to make much territory in the corner unless your opponent ignores you.]

;W[dd]
;B[jc]TR[ie]C[This is a great move.  This attacks the open corner that white left by playing the 5-5 (triangle) point.]

;W[ed]TR[ec]C[Black should respond to this, perhaps with the marked move.  If not, white can do serious damage and take the corner.]

;B[kc]TR[ca][ia][cb][ib][jb][kb][lb][mb][cc][cf][ag][bg][cg][hk][jk][kk][lk][mk][hl][hm]C[At this point, the game is a great example of center territory vs side territory.  A generous estimate would give white 10 points in the center while black controls 3 of the 4 corners giving her approximately 46 points.  The lower left corner, the right side and the top side are not as well defined yet, so we leave them uncounted.]
;W[hc]TR[jh][di]C[This is not a bad move by white.  Marked are some alternatives, each making a play at open areas.]
;B[ji]
;W[ih]
;B[df]TR[dk]C[Black does not need to protect.  Instead, she should go for protecting the lower left corner.]
;W[di]C[Good move.]
;B[dk]
;W[jd]TR[ci]C[White should play the marked move to prevent black from connecting.
