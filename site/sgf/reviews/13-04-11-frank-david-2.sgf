PW[Frank]PB[David]AB[cc][gc][ee][cg][gg]C[Overall, not a bad game.  Black had a game plan for most of the game (sacrifice the bottom left and develop the rest) but there were a few lapses where he thought he could take everything.

Still the result was a black win.  Nice work!]

;B[ce]TR[dg]C[Playing the marked move for black is more effective since it makes you harder to attack.]

;W[dg]TR[de][eg]C[The previous black moves seem to want to sacrifice the corner black stone.  That strategy is fine here, but you should follow through with it and just play moves on the outside.
