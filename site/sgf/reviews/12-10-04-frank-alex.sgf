PW[Frank]PB[Alex]AB[dd][jd][gg][dj][jj]C[It seems like you are picking up on some of the subtleties of moving around on a go board.  It's noticeable even if it is not conscious for you :)

Anyway, nice game overall.  This one had a lot less help from me throughout the game.]

;B[hk]
;W[fl]TR[fk]C[As mentioned before, this is a bad move for W.  That said, one of the variations that I said I would look at is what would happen if B played the marked move.

In general, I said that both sides would gain strength.  See the variation.  An alternative here would be to not make direct contact.]
(;B[dh]LB[ek:A][fk:B]C[This is similar to one of the variations I included, but without the A-B exchange.  What that exchange does is make it more difficult to go into the corner for W.]
