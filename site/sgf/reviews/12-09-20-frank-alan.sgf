PW[Frank]PB[Alan]AB[cc][gc][cg]C[Overall, excellent game.  I really really liked the aggressiveness you played with.  Don't be discouraged with the outcome.  You were about 1 good sequence away from running away with the game.  I had to buckle down in order to pull this game out.

I could tell you to play a much more defensive game and you could win easily, but playing the way you did is far more instructive in my opinion.  You did the right thing by going after my stones.  I did not pull any punches.

You had two really good chances to close this game out.  One was around move 16 and the other was around move 32.  The key will be to identify those moments while you are playing.  

I'm not exactly sure how to explain it except that, at those moments, you can almost see forcing moves that take you to the end of the game.  The basic idea being, you only need half the board + 1 in order to win the game so whenever you see that path, take it.]
